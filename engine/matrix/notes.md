# Matrices in Graphics

images will be stored as a list/matrix of edges

each 2 entries will represent a line

each point is an (x, y) or (x, y, z)

### Matrix Multiplication
- is not commutative
- cols in first matrix must equal # rows in second matrix
- resulting matrix is # rows in first matrix by # cols in 2nd matrix

#### Multiplicative Identity Matrix
- Square
- Diagonal of 1, rest are 0

Use 4 dimension matrices; will be explained when we come back from break
